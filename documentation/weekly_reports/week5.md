## Week 5

### 15.2.

Today I created more tests for calculating functions and fixed errors that occurred in those tests.

Hours: 2

### 17.2.

Today I created even more tests for calculating complex expressions with functions and fixed errors. Now I have tested multiple types of correct and incorrect expressions and the calculator should work correctly. I also created methods to set variables.

Hours: 4

### 18.2.

Today I tested the methods concerning variables. I tried to think about every possible invalid inputs that an user may use.

Hours: 2

### 19.2.

I got the peer review today and I made sure that I fixed errors that my peer evaluator mentioned. My calculator is pretty much done in my opinion, but since I have some time left, next week I'm going to add pi, e and tau as mathematical constants to the calculator.
