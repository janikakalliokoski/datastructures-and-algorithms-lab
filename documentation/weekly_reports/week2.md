## Week 2

### 27.1.
Today I studied the shunting-yard algorithm more and made a rough version of it. I'm having problems with handling negative numbers (e.g. -5) and decimal numbers starting with zero (e.g. 0.5). I also made calculator_io.py and calculator.py files so running the program is easier.
I added pylint to my project and fixed most of the mistakes.

Hours: 6

### 29.1.
Started today by creating a tasks.py file, so it is easier to run the program from terminal.

### Total hours:
