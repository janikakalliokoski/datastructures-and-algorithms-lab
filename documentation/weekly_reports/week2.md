## Week 2

### 27.1.
Today I studied the shunting-yard algorithm and postfix notation more and made a rough version of it. I'm having problems with handling negative numbers (e.g. -5) and decimal numbers starting with zero (e.g. 0.5). I also made calculator_io.py and calculator.py files so running the program is easier.
I added pylint to my project and fixed most of the mistakes.

Hours: 6

### 29.1.
Started today by creating a tasks.py file, so it is easier to run the program from terminal. I created tests for shunting-yard algorithm and fixed the problems I had with negative numbers. I only had to change the order in the parsing method. I have no idea how to test if the algorithm is O(n) or how to do performance testing. I need help with that. Next week I'm going to focus on the calculation of the postfix expression and try to fix the decimal numbers starting with zero (e.g. 0.5) problem I'm having. I finished this week by creating a workflow.

Hours: 4

### Total hours: 10
