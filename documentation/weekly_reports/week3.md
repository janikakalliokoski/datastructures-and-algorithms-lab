## Week 3

### 31.1.

Today I created tests for calculator class and also put the error messages in to the UI. I struggled a bit with creating the StubIO class for the tests but made it work.

Hours: 2,5

### 2.2. & 3.2.

I created the evaluator for the postfix expression. I also documented both Evaluate and Calculator classes.

Hours: 3,5

### 5.2.

Today I started writing the testing document. I also fixed the bug I had with decimal numbers. I think that my project is moving forward well and next week I'm going to add the basic functions to the calculator, e.g. sin(x), ln(x) etc. and test those functions and methods. I'm going to add pylint to the workflow next week, because now I'm getting this fault in my code.

I will have more methods in Calculator class after adding basic functions to the calculator.
So is unit testing all testing I need to do for this project?

Hours: 1

### Total Hours: 7
