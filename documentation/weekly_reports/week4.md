## Week 4

### 9.2.

Today I added basic functions to the calculator. I'm struggling with abs function with negative numbers, so I'm going to work on that next week.
I tested all the methods I created and also documented new code.

Hours: 4

### 10.2.

Today I discovered that none of the functions work with negative numbers. Then I started to fix
that mistake and that took a while. I added some tests also to ensure that the functions now work
correctly with negative numbers and that also an error is raised if a function is empty or a math error occurs. I also started the implementation document.

Hours: 2
