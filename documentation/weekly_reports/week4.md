## Week 4

### 9.2.

Today I added basic functions to the calculator. I'm struggling with abs function with negative numbers, so I'm going to work on that next week.
I tested all the methods I created and also documented new code.

Hours: 4

### 10.2.

Today I discovered that none of the functions work with negative numbers.
