# Week 1
### 18.1
Started this project by going through the options and ended up choosing the scientific calculator that uses shunting-yard algorithm. Today I also studied the shunting-yard algorithm.
### 20.1.
Created the project and repository. I checked my friends repository how to start this project and structure the repository. I also did the [Project Specification](https://github.com/janikakalliokoski/datastructures-and-algorithms-lab/blob/main/documentation/project_specification.md) and registered my project in Labtool.
